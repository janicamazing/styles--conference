                        <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>
                        
                        <p>Our work cultures are living organisms. They are brought to life and shaped by the values, behaviors and practices of people. Nurture your culture, and it will inspire you and your team to do the best work of your lives. Neglect your culture, and it will wreck havoc, making creative thinking impossible. In short, culture is a collective, creative expression and most importantly, it can be designed. Here, you&#39;ll find a collection of curious ways that people are approaching, thinking about and experimenting with culture.

If you lead a team (or want to), work remotely, build stuff with others, wrangle people daily, or just want to learn invaluable techniques for cultivating dynamic team environments, this is the place for you.</p>
                        
                        <p>In Princess&#39;s session she will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. She will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don&#39;t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace&#39;s culture. Once you&#39;ve worked within a culture of design it&#39;s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

                        <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>
                        
                        <p>Creativity is an enigmatic aspect of human experience; it is often difficult to identify what it is that drives this impulse and the elements that inspire an artist&#39;s work. Written from the perspective of a practicing painter and writer, this post brings together ten areas that are sources for artistic inspiration. When an individual chooses a career path of freelance art or design, a career that depends on a constant supply of creativity, it is important to recognize what inspires the work, and how to stimulate one&#39;s imagination
                        For all makers of art and design a crucial source of inspiration is the work of fellow artists, designers and creatives of every kind. Knowledge of art and design history offers a solid grounding on which to make work, while an awareness of contemporary art practice frames the context in which the work is produced. Successive art movements have evolved and thrived by artists taking inspiration from one and otherâ€™s work and this continues to be the case today. At times when inspiration is flagging it is important to look to the work of past masters. When a designer is grappling with an aesthetic problem, they are assisted by the vast history of art that features practitioners who have already &quot;solved&quot; many of these dilemmas.</p>
                        
                        <p>With this workshop, we&#39;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#39;ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We&#39;ll consider why they&#39;re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>

                        <h5>(You Should Be) Testing Your JavaScript</h5>

                        <p>JavaScript is the most used programming language in the world. It has the largest open source package repository in the world (npm). Every type of software application uses JavaScript, including server code (Node.js), productivity apps, AAA 3d games, robots and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. JavaScript has achieved the goal that Java set out to achieve so long ago: write once, run anywhere.</p>

                        <h5>About Finn</h5>

            <p>Although at times violent and aggressive, Finn is a brave and righteous boy. His aspirations to become a great hero makes him somewhat of a moral sheriff in the Land of Ooo, as he is willing to help and protect any innocent person or creature. Finn has a very strong sense of responsibility and becomes upset when he is unable to help others. Due to this and being somewhat simple-minded, Finn often feels conflicted when it is unclear whether something is good or evil as exemplified by his dealings with Marceline. Despite his heroic nature, Finn also takes a liking to a &#34;normal life&#34; without any recognition or praise for being a hero.</p>

            <h5>Death to Wireframes: Long Live Rapid Prototyping</h5>

            <p>Prototyping makes things a little better allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better, faster, increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>

            <h5>About Jake</h5>

            <p>Jake is a proficient dancer, and at one point even showing a dancing bug &quot;how it's done&quot;.Jake also claims to be very proficient at the board game Card Wars. He has a very good understanding of the game, since he was able to explain all of the rules to Finn. However, Finn was able to nearly beat him easily (he purposefully lost to spare Jake&#39;s feelings).Jake can also speak Korean, which he uses to communicate with Lady Rainicorn. </p>
